Stgnal and background samples generations for neural network example.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Example:
gmake clean          				#remove service files 
gmake all             				#create binaries
neuro_pilots 2 500    				#generate text and root data files for signal and background, add data in Tree for root files
root TMVAClassificaton.C			#use root files for classification and weight computations for data in tree
root TMVACLassificationApplication.C#use tree in root file for building hist with values of classification from "weight" direvtory of test events

When done should see 2 root files::
neuro]$ ls *.root
neuro_back.root  neuro_signal.root

When done with TMVAClassification.C should see the "TMVA Plotting macros for Classification", "dataset" directory and TMVA.root file.

When done with TMVAClassificationApplication.C should see the TMVApp.root file with histograms.

=======
gmake clean 
gmake all 
neuro_pilots 2 500
root TMVAClassification_test.C\(\"BDT\"\)
root TMVAClassificationApplication_test.C\(\"BDT\"\)

>>>>>>> 

Example runnign program 'neuro_pilots 2 500' with parameters '1' - level of printing info about program`s work, '500' - numbers of events in output files. Program generate two files with data
 
Exmaple running program "root TMVAClassification_test.C\(\"BDT\"\)" with parameter\(\"BDT\"\) - name of certain classificator. Program makes "TMVA Plotting macros for Classification" on the screen.

Exmaple running program "root TMVAClassificationApplication_test.C\(\"BDT\"\)" with parameter\(\"BDT\"\) - name of certain classificator. Program makes the TMVApp.root file with histograms. There are the names of classificators included in histogram`s names.
